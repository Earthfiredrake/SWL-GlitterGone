## Details

+ Mini-mod: Doesn't use my framework library, so doesn't support the general features that provides, also has no settings

Defect reports are always welcome. The forum post is the ideal place to leave a message, but I also track the CurseForge comments and GitHub's issue tracker. For little things or quick troubleshooting flag me down in discord (@Peloprata on the official server's #modding channel) or look for me in game (often lurking in #Sanctuary).

## Change Log
Version 1.1.1
+ Bugfix: Swapping characters several thousand times no longer runs risk of slow inventory item usage

Version 1.1
+ Swept the glitter out of the corner cases (already open agent interface, agent dossiers)
+ Uses a new and improved function hook, which should eliminate the risk of one particular type of compatibility bug

Version 1.0
+ Released
