# SWL-GlitterGone

Disables special agent sparkle effect

## Links

**Forum Topic**: TBD <br/>
**Download**: TBD <br/>
**Source Repository**: TBD <br/>

## Installation

The packaged release should be unzipped (including the internal folder) into the listed folder:
<br/>SWL: [SWL Directory]\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash

## Details

+ Requires agent interface to be opened before taking effect, so may or may not apply to an agent dossier from the inventory
+ Mini-mod: Doesn't bother with my framework library, so doesn't support the general features that provides, also has no settings

Defect reports are always welcome. The forum post is the ideal place to leave a message, but I also track the CurseForge comments and GitHub's issue tracker. For little things or quick troubleshooting flag me down in discord (@Peloprata on the official server's #modding channel) or look for me in game (often lurking in #Sanctuary).
